# Hashtable

It's an ordered associative array.

Also known as map, set, dictionary.

## Operations

### Set

### Get

## Hash function

Depending on what hash function is used, the hash map may contain more or less collisions. In an extreme example, having a hash table with only colliding keys would effectively be equivalent to an array and searching would no longer require O(1) time, but O(n).
